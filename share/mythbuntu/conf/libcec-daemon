# libcec-daemon will autodetect the HDMI port it is connected to 
#

# but in case detection fails or is incorrect, the correct HDMI port can be
# set as follow:

# port 1 on TV
#HDMI_PORT=tv.1

# port 1 on a connected audio system
#HDMI_PORT=av.1

# or as a hardcoded physical address
#HDMI_PORT=1.0.0.0
